                <h2>How much does Spider cost?</h2>
                <p>
                    We make Spider affordable with bite-sized monthly payments. You get everything you need to start
                    and run your
                    self-employed business and take advantage of potential tax savings for just $349/month or $296/month
                    when paid annually.
                    Since our members saved an average of $10,000* in taxes in 2021, Spider pays for itself in just
                    a few months. Plus,
                    it's 100% tax-deductible â€“ how great is that?
